üìÑ A voxel-based approach for simulating microbial decomposition in soil: Comparison with LBM and improvement of morphological models

Overview
This project provides a computational framework to simulate microbial decomposition of organic matter in soil using 3D computed tomography (CT) images. Unlike traditional geometric models, this approach directly uses voxel information from CT images to construct the simulation space, offering improved accuracy without requiring parameter calibration.

The model incorporates biological and physical processes, including:

Microbial growth and substrate consumption

Diffusion of organic compounds

Transformation of the soil system into a two-phase model (liquid‚Äìsolid)

üîë Key Features
Voxel-Based Representation: Soil microstructure is discretized into a 3D voxel grid directly derived from CT images.

Reaction‚ÄìDiffusion Modeling: Microbial activity is simulated using a validated system of ordinary differential equations coupled with diffusion equations based on Fick‚Äôs law.

Efficient Diffusion Simulation: Compared to Lattice Boltzmann Method (LBM), our approach reduces computational cost by up to 75% while maintaining comparable accuracy.

Machine Learning Integration: Implements a stochastic gradient descent approach to approximate diffusional conductance coefficients in pore network geometrical models (PNGM), improving their precision.

Two-Phase System Handling: After separating the liquid, air, and solid phases, the method simplifies the system to liquid‚Äìsolid interactions for computational efficiency.
